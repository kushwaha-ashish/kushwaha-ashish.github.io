User Story #5: Each dot should have the properties data-xvalue and data-yvalue containing their corresponding x and y values.
User Story #7: The data-xvalue and its corresponding dot should align with the corresponding point/value on the x-axis.
User Story #8: The data-yvalue and its corresponding dot should align with the corresponding point/value on the y-axis.
User Story #9: I can see multiple tick labels on the y-axis with %M:%S time format.
